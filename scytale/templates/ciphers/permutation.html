<p>Permutation ciphers are cool transposition ciphers that use a code word to shuffle letters in a message.</p>

<h3>Encrypting</h3>

<p>The key to a Permutation cipher is a code word.</p>

<p>To encrypt a message, write your code word at the top of a grid. Beneath the codeword, write your message from left to right, moving down a column when you reach the end of a row.</p>

<p>For example, with code word TOMATO and message "WATCH OUT" (I've written the spaces as underscores below, so it's easier to see what's going on):</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>T</th>
        <th>O</th>
        <th>M</th>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>T</th>
        <th>O</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>W</td>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>T</td>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>H</td>
        <td>_</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>U</td>
        <td>T</td>
        <td>_</td>
        <td>_</td>
        <td>_</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>When you have written your entire message out beneath the codeword organise your columns so that your code word at the top is now in alphabetical order.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>M</th>
        <th>O</th>
        <th>O</th>
        <th>T</th>
        <th>T</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>T</td>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>_</td>
        <td>W</td>
        <td>H</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>_</td>
        <td>T</td>
        <td>U</td>
        <td>_</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>_</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Finally, read out your cipher text left to right. Don't forget to include the spaces:</p>

<pre>CTA_WH_TU_O_</pre>

<h3>Decrypting</h3>

<p>To decrypt a message, write the code word at the top of a grid but in alphabetical order (e.g. don't write <code>TOMATO</code> write <code>AMOOTT</code>. Now write the ciphertext out underneath the code word, left-to-right.</p>

<p>Then re-arrange the columns so that the code word is in the correct order. Your ciphertext should now be back to readable english!</p>

<h3>Making Your Own Key</h3>

<p>This is really easy. Simply pick a new code word. A good code word is hard to guess and is a good size. A good size means that it's not so small that it's easy to see groups of letters together (e.g. ABC) or so large that your columns are really short (e.g. SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS)</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here's a key that you can edit. When you change the key the example plaintext will be encrypted for you. Can you see how it all works?</p>

<div class="key">
    <label>Key:</label>
    <input type="text" value="TOMATO">
</div>

<div class="plaintext">
    <label>Example Plaintext:</label>
    <pre>HELLO WORLD</pre>
</div>

<div class="ciphertext">
    <label>Example Ciphertext:</label>
    <pre></pre>
    <p class="error"></p>
</div>
